# Generative-Adversarial-Network

GAN is one of the most Hot topics in AI.Its is use for various application.This repository contained GAN networks.
I am also working on XAI.

1. SRGAN is a generative adversarial network for single image super-resolution. It uses a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes the solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images.
