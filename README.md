# Generative-Adversarial-Network

â€“ Generative adversarial networks, also known as GANs, are composed of a generative and a discriminative model, where the generative model aims at generating the most truthful output that will be fed into the discriminative which aims at differentiating the generated and true image.

GAN is one of the most Hot topics in AI.Its is use for various application.This repository contained GAN networks.
I am also working on XAI.

1. SRGAN is a generative adversarial network for single image super-resolution. It uses a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes the solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images.
